# Data Science Books

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to store documentation of my learning. Many of the books listed below have coding examples and exercises throughout and at the end of each chapter. Within the directory of each book, I will have either jupyter notebooks with examples and exercies or a project relating to that book in the case the book doesn't provide exercises.
